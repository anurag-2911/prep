Design a key-value store in Golang



Requirements of a key-value store and design of the API.

1.Ensure Scalability and Replication: achieve the scalability using consistent hashing and replicate the partitioned data.
2.Versioning Data and Achieving Configurability: resolve the conflicts that occur due to changes made by more than one entity, 
  and make the system more configurable for different use cases.
3.Enable Fault Tolerance and Failure Detection: make the key-value store fault tolerant and detect failures in the system.
